# Youtube-auto-brand-account-create
Youtube auto brand account create using selenium by python

Please note: Use accounts that do not have two-factor authentication.

Replace the 56th and 57th lines in the script with your Gmail email address and password (use a Gmail account that does not have brand accounts).

In the brand.py script, I have added code to create up to 5 auto brand accounts. If you want to create more accounts, add lines 81 to 95 in line 142. For the purpose of recording a video, I have created 1 brand account.

To begin, open the command prompt and enter "pip install Random" followed by hitting the enter button. Then enter "pip install undetected_chromedriver" and hit enter again.

After downloading the folder, extract it and open the command prompt. Enter "Python" to find your Python version.

Download the Chromedriver (https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) and extract it to the downloaded folder, making sure it matches the version of Chrome on your PC.

To run the script, enter "brand.py" in the folder location in the command prompt, or double-click on the brand.py file
👉Note:-

👉if your selenium version is in latest version then the code never run

👉open cmd and enter pip uninstall selenium

And enter

pip install selenium==4.2.1 or pip install selenium==4.2.0

and hit enter

and

python -c "import selenium; print(selenium.version)"
